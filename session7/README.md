# Session 7 Assignment

This assignment is to learn how to optimize model structure and take step by step decisions to improve model performance. The objective was to get more than 99.4% accuracy in test/dev set for MNIST dataset such that model has less than 8,000 parameters and must achieve this in 15 epochs.

Ran all the notebooks in colab.
## Block 1

In this block there are 3 notebooks. This block is mostly about getting code structure and model skeleton correct without any fancy stuff, to be able to do fast experimentation.

## Block 2

In this block also there are 3 notebooks. This block is about getting model correct taking into account capacity, efficiency, regularization and receptive field.

## Block 3

In this block there are 2 notebooks. This block is about pushing model further using augmentations and dynamic learning rate strategies.
